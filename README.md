**Intro:**
Hello guys, I will try to explain shortly about linear regression models. As far as there is many documentation of machine learning, here we are going to discuss about supervised model which has two types. linear regression is focused into numerical data and on the other hand, classification is related to categorical data.

- **point 1:** How to define the model? 
A linear regression model can be represented as a linear combination of features to represent a label. It is like a line with an slope ans intercep(bias).

y = a*x + b

In general, we can consider an hiperplane of n dimensions:

Y_pred = a1x1 +a2X2 + ... + an*Xn + b0

Where:

ai are the weights
Xi are the features
b0 is the bias.
In matriz format:

Y = A dot X

About the weigths, there are 2 concepts:

Slope is the measue of how steep is the data distributed on the plane.
Intercept(Bias) is like a default value of the label when there is no data. The default level of toxity.

- **point 2:** How to get the weights? How to define the algorithm?
- **point 3:** How to measure if our algorithm is the best? How to get the best weigths?
- **point 5:** How to evaluate the results?
- **point 4:** How to optimize the algorithm?
