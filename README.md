**Intro:**
Hello guys, I will try to explain shortly about linear regression models. As far as there is many documentation of machine learning, here we are going to discuss about supervised model which has two types. linear regression is focused into numerical data and on the other hand, classification is related to categorical data.

- **point 1:** How to define the model? 
- **point 2:** How to get the weights? How to define the algorithm?
- **point 3:** How to measure if our algorithm is the best? How to get the best weigths?
- **point 5:** How to evaluate the results?
- **point 4:** How to optimize the algorithm?
